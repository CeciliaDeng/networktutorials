This hands-on workshop is part of the Microbiome Data Analyses Workshop (Hasselt, 2021). 
In this workshop, we will introduce a new method for network inference and we will walk you through the steps necessary to start analyzing your network with other software. 

We recommend first going through the FlashWeave tutorial, so you have a network to work with. 
However, after that, feel free to choose an analysis method of your choice and keep working on this. 
During the hands-on, Lisa will demonstrate how to use the anuran method to analyze FlashWeave results. 

The following tutorials are available:  
* [Installing FlashWeave](https://ramellose.github.io/networktutorials/installation_flashweave.html)  
* [Running FlashWeave on sponge networks](https://ramellose.github.io/networktutorials/running_flashweave.html)
* [Working with igraph in R]()  
* [Working with NetworkX in Python]()  
* [Running manta on FlashWeave networks]()  
* [Running anuran on FlashWeave networks]()
